# Introduction to Science



## Alethiology

	**Standards of Truth**
		| Coherence:		| Self-consistent, even Well-defined, in [meaning]("not necessarily notation").	|
		| Correspondence:	| Matching empirical measurements.												|
		| Authority:		| Agreement of particular community members.									|
		| Consensus:		| Agreement of many community members.											|
	**A-Priori**: Self-evident, self-proving
		Nothingness
			"The Nothing Itself Nothings" - Martin Heidegger
		Existence
		[Variation]("Distinction, or Logos")
			Variables/context can be created.
			Variables/context can be related.
		Empirical Data
			Empiricism:			Information is derived from senses.
			Naive Empiricism:	Information is only the senses.


## Philosophy of Science

	***Scientific Theory***: An [epistemically]("Definition: ''relating to the validation of knowledge''") predictive^^&dagger; mathematical relation between [empirically]("Definition: ''verifiable by observation or experience''") measurable phenomenon.
		&dagger; The need to be epistemically predictive is [debated]("Explain vs Describe").
		[**Predictive**:]("Epistemically Predictive") Theories logically precede data.
			Models aren't just fitted to data.
				| Mechanistic Model:		| Description derived from more basic concepts.	|
				| Phenomenological Model:	| Description fitted to data.					|
				| Reference Model:			| Description is unrefined data.				|
			Irrelevant what precedes what temporally.
		**Operationalization**: Immeasurable phenomenon defined through their relations to measurable phenomenon.
			Rational Operationalization: These immeasurable phenomenon must be represented & defined mathematically.[math](science/rational_empirical_bridge.eqn.xml)
		**Falsifiability**: Theories must be able to be proven false through empirical measurements.	
	**Philosophical Razors**
		Correspondence Principle: New Theories should reduce/simplify to Old Theories.
	**Preventing Scientism**
		What Science is Not.
			Science is not Skepticism.
			Science is not a Religion. 
			Science is not Mystical.
			Science is not Magical.
			Science is not Big or Beyond.
				Scientists are just people.
				Science makes small incremental steps. 
				Emergence: Larger Entities out of Smaller Entities.
					| [Determinism:]("Fundamental Determinism, Emergent Determinism")			| All calculable from initial state.	|
					| [Probabilism:]("Fundamental Indeterminism, Emergent Determinism")			| Some calculable from initial state.	|
					| [Non-Indeterminism:]("Emergent Determinism")								| Determinism or Probabilism.			|
					| [Indeterminism:]("Fundamental Indeterminism, No Emergence")				| Not calculatable from initial state.	|
		Stupid Arguments
			Science vs Religion: Incomparable: Different Standards of Truth.
			Hypothesis vs Theory: Petty Jargonization. 
			How to do Science
				Inductive Reasoning
				Deductive Reasoning
				Abductive Reasoning
				Epistemic Anarchy
		Buzzwords to Avoid
			*Nano-*
			*Biotech*
			Futurology


## Philosophy of Engineering

	**Engineering**: The use of scientific theories and [data]("descriptions of phenomenon") to create Technology.
		Technology: Machines and Methods.
			Method: Systematic action-series designed to complete a task.
			Machine: Semi-independent object designed to complete a task.
				Simple Machine: Changes the force vector or energy type.
				Compound Machine: Made up of simpler machines.
		Utility: Decrease in work-needed to accomplish a task.
	**Are-Ought Bridge**
		What's Ideal.
		What's realistic. 
		What's optimal.


## Practical Science & Engineering

	**Measurements**
		Quantitative Measurements:
			Context: Measurand & Measurer
			Magnitude: Numerical Constant
			Unit: Quantum of Standardized Dimension
				Operationalism: Unit is from the operation of measuring.
			Uncertainty: Characterization of Dispersion
		Qualitative Measurements: Not Quantitative.
		Ordinal Measurements: Relating to relative order.
		Error:
			Random (Inconsistent) Error: Difference in all directions (axes).
			Systematic (Consistent) Error: Difference in particular direction(s) (axes).
			Mathematical Error: Measured vs. True.
			Scientific Error: Measured vs. Theoretical.
			Experimental Error: Error in the context of experiment.
			Observational Error: Error in the context of observation.
	**Experimental Design**
		Variable Dependence:
			||
			| Independent				|	Dependent						&
			| y(?,?,?)					|	y(x,?,?)						&
			| \[ \frac{d}{dx}(y)=0\]	|	\[ \frac{d}{dx}(y) \neq 0 \]	&
			||
			Intrinsic Variables: Independent of quantity.
			Extrinsic Variables: Dependent on quantity.
		Controls:
			Positive control: Known Response.
			Negative (Independent) control: No Response.
			Background Noise: transverses variables and controls.
			Red Teams: External perspective to prevent confirmation bias.
		Multiplicity
			Experiments per Individual
			Individuals per Experiment
