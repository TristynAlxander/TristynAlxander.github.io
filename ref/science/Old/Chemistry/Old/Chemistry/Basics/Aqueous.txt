Acids & Bases
	Better to think of acids in terms of their conjugate base
	Bronstedâ€“Lowry definition
		Acid: Donates H+
		Base: Accepts H+
		
		conjugate base: B^{-}
			If weak, strong acid
		conjugate acid: AH^{+}
			If weak, strong base
	Lewis definition: B: --> A^{+}
		Acid: Accepts an Electron Pair
			Unfilled Orbitals
		Base: Donates an Electron Pair
	
	
	
	Acids: HA \rightarrow H^{+} + A^{-}
		Organic Acids
			Low Electronegativity
			Either C or electro negative atom
			carboxylic acids: CO_{2}H
			amino acids NH_{2}
			zwitterion
		Organic Bases
			High Electronegativity
			
	Bases: B + H^{+} \rightarrow BH^{+}
	Conjugate Acid-Base Pair
		AH + B \leftrightarrow  A^{-} +  BH^{+} 
	Acidity Constant: \( K_{a} \)
		K_{a} = \frac{[BH^{+}][A^{-}]}{[AH]}
			where B is the solvent (generally water)
			Strong acid, larger K_{a}
			Strong Base, Smaller K_{a}
		pK_{a} = -\log K_{a}
			This is relative to the conjugate base
			Strong Acid, Lower pK_{a}
			Strong Base, Higher pK_{a}
		Common \(K_{a}\)'s
	The proton would rather be attached to the stronger conjugate base
	ion-product constant 
		for water K_{w} = 10^{-14}
	Weak: Partially Dissociate 
	Strong: Completely Dissociate
		Base: MOH where M is Row1[1 to 5] or Row2[2 to 4]
		Acid: Row17[1 to 3], 
	pH
		pX \equiv -log([X])
		pK_a = pH @ [A^{-}] = [HA]
		pI
			pH @ neutral charge for mixture 
			pH:Low::Charge:Negative
