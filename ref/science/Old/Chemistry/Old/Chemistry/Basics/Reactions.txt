Atoms are neither destroyed not created (chemically)
Same Reaction can go many routes (S_{N}1, S_{N}2, etc), but often different rates*
	*Enzymes/?Catalysis? are selective about way reaction occurs 

Polarity: Natural Polar State
Polarizability: Ability to be polarized by an Electric Field
	larger = More Polarizable
Nucleophilic: Negative Charge
	Free Or Distributed Electrons (Pi-bonds & Lone Pairs)
	Neutral, Negative, or Negatively Polarized Charge 
	Polar Bonds: More Electronegative Atoms
		Especially with stable atoms, like metals. (Filled Orbitals)
Electrophilic: Positive Charge
	Neutral, Positive, or Positively Polarized Charge
	Polar Bonds: Less Electronegative Atoms
		Especially Hydrogen
		Especially with Highly Electronegative Atoms like N,O,F
	Polarizable Atoms
		Large Atoms
		Less Stable Alone (Unfilled Orbitals)
electrophilic addition




Organic Reactions
	Bond Breaking
		Homolytic Reactions:   \( AB \rightarrow  A \cdot + B \cdot \)
		Heterolytic Reactions: \( AB \rightarrow  A^{+} + B:^{-} \)
	Bond Formation
		Polar Reactions: \( A^{+} + B:^{-} \rightarrow AB \)
			Nucleophilies: Compound with attacking electrons.
				Note: Can't be Radical.
			Electrophiles: Compound attacked by electrons. 
		Radical Recombination: \( A \cdot + B \cdot \rightarrow AB \)
		Pericyclic Reaction
	Free Radical Reactions
		1: Initiation (fast)
			Light/Heat activated Homolysis
		2: Propagation (fast)
			Radical Substitution
				Radical activated Homolysis of sigma Bond
				Radical Recombination
				Repeat
			Polymers
			Radical Addition
				Radical activated Homolysis of pi Bond 
				Radical Recombination
				Repeat
		3: Termination (slow)
			Radical Recombination
Types of Reactions
	Additions:		\( A + B \rightarrow AB \)
	Eliminations:	\( AB \rightarrow A + B \)
	Substitutions:  \( AB + CD \rightarrow AD + CB \)
	Rearrangements: \( AB \rightarrow BA \)
