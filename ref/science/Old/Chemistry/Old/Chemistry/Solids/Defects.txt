Defects 
	direction does not change
	but crystal pattern fails
strain/stress to minimize energy
	Stress field very local 
Modify Properties
	free dislocations --> ductile Metals 
	@ surface dislocations: Reaction rates increase
	more
Types 
	impurities: unwanted defects
	dopants: wanted defects
	
solid solution
	Lots of substitutions
	Same Crystal Structure
	
Point Defects (0D)
	vacancies
		Schottky defects
			ionic
			Paired (based on charge) vacancies 
			n_{s} \approx N e^{\frac{-\Delta H_{s}}{2k_{B}T}}
				n_{s}										(m^{-3})	Schottky defects per unit volume
				N											(m^{-3})	sites affected by defects per unit volume
				\Delta H_{s}								(J)			Energy to create a Schottky defect
				k_{B} = R / N_{A} =1.3806488 * 10^{-23}		(J/K)		Boltzmann's constant
				T											(K)			Temperature
				n_{s}*2						Number of vacancies
	interstitials
		interstitials impurities
		self-interstitial
	Frenkel Defects
		ionic
		vacancy-interstitial Pairs
		n_{F} \approx \sqrt{N N*} e^{\frac{-\Delta H_{F}}{2k_{B}T}}
			N				Number of normally occupied positions (Not like other N's)
			N*				Number of interstitial positions available to a displaced ion (Not like other N's)
	substitutional

n_{d} \approx N e^{\frac{-\Delta H}{k_{B} T}}
	n_{d}										(m^{-3})	defects per unit volume
	N											(m^{-3})	sites affected by defects per unit volume
	\Delta H									(J)			enthalpy
	k_{B} = R / N_{A} =1.3806488 * 10^{-23}		(J/K)		Boltzmann's constant
	T											(K)			Temperature
	n_{d}/N										()			Fraction of atom sites which contain a defect
.
N = #_{a,uc} / V_{uc}
	#_{a,uc}			Number of particular atoms per unit cell
	V_{uc}				Volume per unit cell
	Note: Schottky defects: N = number of atoms of a particular charge per unit cell
.
N = \rho N_{A} / MM
	\rho					Density
	N_{A} = 6.02214129*10^{23}				(mol^{-1})				Avogadro constant
	MM						Molar Mass

Line Defects (1D)

Plane Defects (2D)
	Edge Dislocations: Inset new plane.
		Dislocation line: \perp up points toward new plane
		Stress around Change
		Shear will push dislocation out
	Screw Dislocations 
	
	Burgers Circuit
		Perfect Crystal Closes
		Burgers Vector
			What's needed to make it close.
			Perpendicular to edge dislocation
				Measured righthand rule, start to finish. 
			Parallel to screw dislocation
