Ceramics: Metal + Nonmetal (inorganic)
.
Properties
	chemically inert
	Strong Bonding 
	hard & brittle
		Good under compression
		Bad under stress or flex
	lack of free electrons
		thermal and electronic insulators
	
.
electroceramics: Care about electric Properties
	(often) high-purity
	Dopable 
noncrystalline ceramics: Glasses 
Refractory ceramics: Using at High Temps
traditional ceramics: silicates
	Low-quality: Clay
	Higher-quality: Measured Quantities 
	Methods: Powderize -> Shape -> Fire
		vitrification: Produces Glasses
	minerals 
	Aluminium can substitute silicon randomly 
	Basic Unit: tetrahedra [SiO_{4}]^{4-} 
		vertices shared, never edges or faces
		Isolated: Isolated, paired, 3-ring, 4-ring, 6-ring
		Chains or Sheets: 
			Chains: (like polymer)
				Single Chain (pyroxenes)
				Double Chain (2 pyroxenes)
			Sheets:
				Single Layered: Many Chains
				Double: Stacked Singles
			Networks:
