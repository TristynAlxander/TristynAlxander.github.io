Metals: metallic elements
	pure
		Structures: 
			Usually: A1, A2, A3
			A1: cubic close-packed (FCC)
			A2: body-centred cubic (BCC)
			A3: hexagonal close-packed
			Coordination Number: # of nearest neighbours
			Atomic Packing Factor
				APF = N_{uc} V_{a} / V_{uc}
					N_{uc}		Number of atoms in a unit cell
					V_{a}		Volume of an atom
					V_{uc}		Volume of a unit cell
			Differences from bonding properties
			semimetals =/= Semiconductors 
				more pronounced bonding effects
			Metallic radii

	alloy
		Substitutional
			Guideline:  Hume-Rothery Rules
				1:	Atomic Radius: -15% < %diff < +15%
				2:	Crystal Structures: match
				3:	Valency: Same
				4:	Electro-negativity: Similar
			Geometry: Ordered (Patterned) or Not
		Interstitial
			Guideline: Half size
			Geometry: tetrahedral (x2) or octahedral(x1)

Metallic glasses
	General Formula
	T_{70–90} (SM)_{0–15} (NM)_{10–30}
		T is one or more transition metals
		(SM) is one or more semimetals
		(NM) is one or more nonmetals

	Rapidly cooled metals are Metallic glasses
		Disrupt crystallization
		utilize deep eutectic point
		Very different crystal structures
		Differing Sizes
		Rapid cooling
.
Wiedemann–Franz law
\frac{\sigma_{T}}{\sigma_{C}}=\frac{3Tk^{2}}{e^{2}}
	\sigma_{T}		Thermal Conductivity
	\sigma_{e}		Electrical
	T				Temperature
	k				Boltzmann's constant
	e				Electron Charge

high reflectivity: Electrons Easily Rise and fall
Ductility: Easily roll + Defects
Hardening: Interstitials
