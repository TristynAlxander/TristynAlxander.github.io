Glasses
	(Usually) Inorganic Oxides
	Some Metallic Glass Now
	Properties: hard, transparent, fairly strong, corrosion-resistant
	Silicate Glasses:
		SiO_{2}
		Slow Nucleation
	
	Supercooled
		Made via Rapid Cooling
		structures depends on cooling rate
		amorphous: lack of long range order
		
		Is Solid. Can Be Thought of Viscus Liquid.
		liquid ->solid (without crystal formation)
		Doesn't Melt. Softens. No Sharp melting point.
	
	Glass Transition Temperature: T_{g}
		Graph Specific Volume (m^{3}kg^{-1}) vs. Temperature (K)
		Find Intersect
		Depends on Cooling Rate
	
	Random Network Model
		Network Formers: Small Cations (adopt a particular shape)
		Network Modifiers: large Cations (disrupt shapes)
		Intermediates
	
	
	
	
	\eta = \eta_{0} e^{E/RT}
		\eta viscosity
	
	
	Vogel–Fulcher–Tamman equation
	\eta = A e^{B/(T-T_{0})}
	
	
	non-Arrhenian: Fragile
	Arrhenian: Strong
	
	Strengthening: Use Ion Size to change compression/tension
		strong in compression
		weak in tension
		Tensile vs Plane (Seem to always be opposite)
	
.
	spinodal decomposition
	Not (Usually) thermodynamically stable (will eventually crystalize)
