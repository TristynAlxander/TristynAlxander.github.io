Molar Mass
	M_{n}		Number average molecular mass
	M_{v}		Viscosity molecular mass
	M_{w}		Weight average molecular mass

========================================================================================
Mn	number average molecular mass;

M_{n} = \sum x_{i} M_{i}

x_{i}= n_{i} / n_{T}

	M_{i}		Mass i
	x_{i}		Probability of M_{i}
	n_{i}		Number of M_{i} particles
	n_{T}		Total number of particles

Mv	viscosity molecular mass; 




Mw	weight average molecular mass

M_{w} = \sum w_{i} M_{i}

w_{i} = \frac{n_{i} M_{i}}{\sum_{j} n_{j} M_{j}}

w_{i}		Mass probability


Degree of Polymerization (Number of mers mass m)
N_{?} = M_{?}/m

lamella
	folded polymers into a block 

Fast Cooling: Short & Branched
	low density
	low refractive index
	very flexible but weak
.
fraction of crystalline polymer
x_{c} = \frac{\rho_{s} - \rho_{a}}{\rho_{c} - \rho_{a}}
	s	sample
	c	crystal
	a	amorphous 
.
Tacticity
	disposition of side-groups, big effect
	isotactic: all same side
	syndiotactic: alternating sides 
	atactic: random
.
Cross links strengthen
.
Copolymers
	2 polymers together
addition polymers and condensation polymers
step growth and chain growth
	step growth: add chains together
	chain growth: one by one 
Initiation
	(ccan be high energy, or active molecules)
Propagation
	Catalyst for control
Termination
	two growing chains to meet and join
		has free radical
	disproportionation,
		steal Hydrogen
		if H comes from middle middle will have a free radical
Free readicals can induce polymerization
Metallocene catalysis
