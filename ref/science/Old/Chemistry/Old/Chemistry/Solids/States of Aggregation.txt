States of Aggregation

Sense of Scale
	Macro: mm		eye
	Micro: um		optical 
	Nano: nm		cleverness
.
Crystalline Solids
	Single/Pure Crystalline Solids
		Long Ranger Order 
		"infinite"
	Polycrystalline solids
		Short Range (local) Order
		Multiple: small single crystals
		grain boundaries
Noncrystalline solids
	Short range order
	Types
		glasses
			(Usually) inorganic substance
			mostly transparent
			high-temperature liquid to solid (without crystal formation) Transition
			structures depend on cooling rate
			described as supercooled liquids
				Don't melt, just soften
				spinodal decomposition
			Not (Usually) thermodynamically stable (will eventually crystalize)
		polymers
			Monomers
			synthetic
			natural
			Most have carbon Frame
		amorphous
			Solids evaporated and condensed onto cool surfaces (without crystal formation)
			Can usually make Crystallize
			(exp. Aerogels)
Partly crystalline

Solidification
	Rapid --> amorphous or poorly crystalline
	Slow --> large crystals or single crystals
	Steps
		Nucleation: Small Volumes take crystal form
			esp. @ edges or Dust
			Single nucleus --> Single Crystal 
		Crystal growth
			Normally polycrystalline
			dendritic growth: Tree like 
		Processing
			Working
				Usually Metals
				More Defects --> Stronger
				Strain Energy In
			Heat Treatment
				Usually Metals
			Annealing
				Usually Metals
				heat to half melting Point
				partly recrystallise
				Strain Energy Out
				Softer
			Polymer Linking
				Usually (Thermoplastic) Polymers
				rigidity and strength
			Devitrification
				Result: glass ceramics
			Sintering (powder metallurgy)
				Usually powder 
				Compressed and heated (temp below melting point)
				Result: Strong polycrystalline solid
				high-density solid with little porosity
			Dehydration
