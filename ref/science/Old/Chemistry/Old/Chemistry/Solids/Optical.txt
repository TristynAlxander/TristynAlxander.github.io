Scattering
surface scattering 
	reflection and refraction
diffraction
	scattering by objects of similar size

Absorbance 
	E_{photon, absorbed} = E_{2}-E_{2}
		Must equal exact difference in energy level gaps
.
Sources of light
	Luminescence: low heat radioactivity
	Incandescence: Hot thing
.
black body
Edlamda = \frac{2 pi h c^2 d lamda}{lambda^5 e^{hc/(lambda k T)}-1}
.


evenly distributed absorbion centers
I = I_{0} e^(-alpha l)
	l	thickness
	alpha	linear absorption coefficient
	I	intensity

Beer–Lambert law
log(I/I_{0}) = -\verepsilon [J] l
	\verepsilon		molar absorption coefficient or extinction coefficient
	[J]				molar concentration of absorption centres or absorbing species
	A = \verepsilon [J] l		absorbance or optical density
	T = I/I_{0}			transmittance

reflectivity
R = r^2 = ((n0 - n1)/(n0+n1))^2
