Insulators aka dielectrics
	small voltage -> No Current
	Large Empty Band Gap
Definitionally: Naturally non-conductive

Strong Bonds or Tightly Bound
	Many Oxides
.
Electric Fields: \vec{E}	(+ --> -)
	\vec{E}_{0} 		External Electric Field + --> -
	E_{loc}	(V m^{-1})	local electric field (varies point by point)
	E_{loc} = E_{0} + \sum_{i} E_{i}
		E_{i}	some internal field 

Permittivity: \varepsilon
	Relative Permittivity:	\varepsilon_{r}
	Free Permittivity:		\varepsilon_{0}
	Describes a solid (or free space)'s electric permittivity when exposed to an electric field
	
	Dielectric Susceptibility: \chi = (\varepsilon_{r} -1)

	Complex Dielectric Constant: \varepsilon_{r} = \varepsilon_{0} (\varepsilon' - i \varepsilon'')
	\tan(\delta) = \frac{\varepsilon''}{\varepsilon'}
	\tan(\delta)	loss tangent (energy loss in a capacitor)
	
	Visible range: n^2 = \varepsilon_{r}
		n index of material
	Lorentzâ€“Lorenz equation: \frac{n^{2}-1}{n^{2}+2} = \frac{N \alpha_{e}}{3 \varepsilon_{0}}
	
Total Polarisability:						\alpha_{tot} = \sum N_{j} \alpha_{j}
	Electronic Polarisability:				\alpha_{e}	
	Ionic Polarisability:					\alpha_{i}
		Can't follow after 10^{14}			
	Orientational Polarisability:			\alpha_{d}
	Space Charge Polarisability:			\alpha_{s}
		Can't follow after 10^{6} Hz		
	Which ever one of these is dipoles		
		can't follow after 10^{9} Hz		
	\alpha (Compound) = \sum n \alpha(components)
	Polarisability's Frequency dependence:	\alpha(f)
		low Frequency is near static (more time to react)
		Frequency up, polarisability down. 
	More & Greater distance electrons --> nuclear charge has less control --> more polarizabillity
	Periodic Table: left and down is more polarizabillity
	
	
	
	alpha' = \frac{alpha}{ 4 pi \varepsilon_{0}}
	alpha' *(4 pi \varepsilon_{0}) = alpha 
	
	
Electric Dipole Moment: \vec{p} or \vec{\mu} (C m)
	p = q \times r
		q				charge 
		r				charge separation
	p = \alpha N E_{loc}
		\alpha			polarisability
		N	(m^{-3})	dipoles per unit volume
		E_{loc}			Electric Feild

	???		P = \sum_{i} N_{i} p_{i}		???
	P = \varepsilon_{0} (\varepsilon_{r} -1) E_{0}
		\varepsilon_{r}			Relative Permittivity
		\varepsilon_{0}			Free Permittivity
		\vec{E}_{0} 			External Electric Field + --> -
		@Conditions:

	V_{m} = 1/N
	V_{m}		Volume of one formula unit
	V_{m} = a_{0}^{3} / Z

Dielectric : electric field creates polarization (P(E))
	Piezo-electric: Stress creates polarization P(\sigma,E)
		Accumulation of Dipoles 
			Dipoles via Stress
				Geometry. Ex: Pyramid shape
				Direction of Stress
			Accumulation vis Directionality
				Aligned not Random
			
		piezoelectric coefficient: d = P/\sigma
		
		discrepancy between +charge & -Charge centers
		
		not centre of symmetry is elementary dipole
		
		if it has it it's always there??? Stress makes more align??
		
		
		Examples: Atomic Force microscope, thermal evaporator
		
		pyro electric:  Change in temperature creates Change in polarization \Delta P(\sigma,E,\Delta T)
			Not thermoelectric because pyro changes over time
				because if not the charges on the surface neutralize it
			
			\Delta P_{s} = \pi_{i} \Delta T 
				P_{s}	sponanious polarizability
				\pi 	pyroelectric coeffecient 
			unique polar axis,which is a direction in the crystal unrelated bysymmetry to any other direction, not even theantiparallel direction
			ferro electric : spontanieous polarization and can switch directions
				Cation anion slushing  eiher way, but middle is bump in potential energy 
				Grains may need to be aligned (best to make it with no grains)
				Hysteresis
					P(E)
