	Extrinsic semiconductors: Doping causes jump
		n-type semiconductors: Donors, donating electrons to conduction band
		p-type semiconductors: Acceptors, accepting electrons from valence band, donating holes to valence band
		Compensated semiconductor: #donors equals #acceptors
		
		exhaustion range: impurities are fully ionised
		Completely Ionized: n + N_{a} = p + N_{d}
		n + N_{a}^{-} = p + N_{d}^{+}
			N_{a}^{-} holes created by acceptors
			N_{a} acceptors per unit volume
			N_{d}^{+} electrons by donors
			N_{d} donors per unit volume
 
			n(n-type) \approx N_{d}
			p(n-type) \approx \frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{d}}
			n(p-type) \approx \frac{n_{i}^{2}}{N_{a}}
