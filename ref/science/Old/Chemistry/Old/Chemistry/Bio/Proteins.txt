	Tertiary
			Globular: More likely enzymes
				domains often fold Globular
				water-soluble globular proteins
				lipid-soluble membraneous proteins
				Motifs (folds)
					General Rules
						Hydrophobic interactions are important stabilizing forces
						Helices and sheets in the same protein generally occupy different layers
						Motifs are composed of residues that are not adjacent in the primary sequence
						Loop regions that connect secondary structures do not cross each other
						ß-strands within sheets prefer a slight right-handed twist
					Examples:
						beta alpha beta Loop
						beta barrel
							(right handed)
						beta / alpha Barrel
				Taxonomy (Based off Motifs)
					PDB identifier > Fold > Superfamily > Family > Proteine > Species
					All alpha
					All beta
					beta / alpha
					beta + alpha
			Fibrous: More likely Structural
				typically insoluble
				Examples:
					\alpha-keratin (S-S)							Tough, Rigid
						\alpha helix
						Ex: nails, horns, Hair
					Collagen (Lys-HyLys)							Strong
						Ex: tendons, cartilage, connective tissue
						Left handed helix
							Gly-Pro-Pro
							4-Hydroxyproline
								post-translational processed Pro
								prolyl hydroxylase AND a-ketoglutarate, molecular oxygen, and ascorbate (vitamin C)
								more hydrogen bonds
						right-handed superhelical triple helix
							Really Strong
						
					Silk fibroin (van der Waals)		Soft, flexible
						Ex: egg sac, nest, web
						Antiparallel Beta Sheets
						Close Packing (Ala and Gly)
						hydrogen bonding within sheets
						London dispersion interactions between sheets
						Spider Silk
							composite material
