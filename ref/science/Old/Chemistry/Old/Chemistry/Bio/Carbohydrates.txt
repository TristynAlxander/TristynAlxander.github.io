Types
	General
		C_{x} (H_{2}O)_{y}
	Classification
		Chain Size
		Number of Sugar Units
		C=O location
		Stereochemistry
	By Number of Sugar Units
		Mono-saccharides		1
		Di-saccharides			2
		Oligo-saccharides		3-12
		Poly-saccharides		>12
	C=O location
		Aldose has Aldehyde
		Ketose has Ketone
	Cyclization
		OH to H end
	Hemi-
		alcohol + Aldehyde/ketonr
		R/H, R,RO and an OH on a carbon

Natural all D-Enantiomer, rather than L


Chair vs Boat conformation
	never actually Haworth Projection

Animeric Carbon
	Carbon 1
	attaches to O

Mono-saccharides
	D-glyceraldehyde
	D-glucose
		C4 OH not with CH_{2}OH
	D-fructose
		5 sided
	D-galactose
		C4 OH with CH_{2}OH
	D-ribose
		5 sided

Di-saccharides
	glycosides: sugar acetals
	glycosidic bonds
		O-bridges
		\alpha vs \beta 
			\alpha opposite side of CH_{2}OH
			\beta same side as CH_{2}OH
			if bonded, look at remaining hemiacetal
		a or B (C# --> C#)
	broken down by humans
		Maltose = glucose + glucose
			alpha (1-->4) bond
			isomaltose
				alpha 1-->6
		Lactose = galactose + glucose
			beta (1-->4) bond
			Galactosemia: lack of enzymes to conversion galactose to glucose
		Sucrose = glucose + fructose
			alpha (1-->2)
	Cellobiose = glucose + glucose
			beta (1-->4) bond

Poly-saccharides
	Starch (Plants)
		Amylose:		Straight Chain
			alpha (1 --> 4)
		Amylopectin:	Branched Structure
			alpha (1 --> 4) Normal
			alpha (1 --> 6)	Cross
	Glycogen (Animals)
		In Liver & Muscles
		Attached to Glycogenin
		beta (1 --> 4) Normal
		alpha (1 --> 6)	Cross
