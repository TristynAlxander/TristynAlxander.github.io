Spectroscopy: Study of Light-Matter Interactions

Sense = Direction




Polarity
	Light is composed of electric and magnetic fields
		Interactions Focus on Charged, Polar, and Polarizabile Molecules & Particles.
	Dipoles
		Permanent Dipole
			Electronegativity Differences
			[math](equations/Permanent_Electric_Dipole_Moment.eqn)
		Instantaneous Dipole: Coincidental Electron Concentration due to Movement
		Induced Dipole
			Separation of charge due to external Electric Field.
			[math](equations/Induced_Electric_Dipole_Moment.eqn)
				Polarizability
					[math](equations/Polarizability_of_Oscillating_Molecule.eqn)
		Bond Dipole Moment
			Arises from bond polarity
			Sums to Permanent molecular dipole Moment
		Vague Rules
			| Heteronuclear Diatomics				| Permanent Dipole.		|
			| Homonuclear Diatomics					| No Dipole.			|
			| Polyatomics with inversion center		| No Dipole.			|
			| Polyatomics without inversion center	| Usually Dipole.		|

Vibrational spectroscopy
	Inferred Spectroscopy
		Different Frequencies
		Emphasis on Transmittance & Absorbance
			Must be a change in the dipole moment with vibration for absorbance to occur
			Absorption of Light
				Oscillating Permanent Dipole at same frequency as electric field of light
				resonance Absorption 
			Transmittance
				T = I_{s} / I_{R}
					T		Transmittance
					I_{s}	Intensity of Sample 
					I_{r}	Intensity of Reference
		Set Up
			Source (Block Signal)
				*Glow Bar* (a heated ceramic)
				Helium Neon (for alignment)
			Container (IR-Transparent)
				Salt Windows
			Detectors
				Pyroelectric
				Monolayers
					liq.N2 cooled (removes thermal noise)
	Raman Spectroscopy
		Single Frequency
		Emphasis on Scattering

				Virtual Energy State: 
					Electron is not actually promoted because photon is not actually absorbed ^^^(How ^^^can ^^^we ^^^prove ^^^this?)
					Photon energy is changed during scattering
			Rayleigh Scattering
				Same Energy (Different Direction)
				Light's Electric Field Frequency
			Raman Scattering: 
				Different Energy
					Photon energy is changed during inelastic scattering
					Think of the relative impulse if the point of contact is moving away from a ball as it contacts or with the ball as it bounces
				Stokes Scattering
					Less Energy
					Difference of Light's Electric Field Frequency and Molecule's Vibrational Frequency
				Anti-Stokes Scattering
					More Energy
					Sum of Light's Electric Field Frequency and Molecule's Vibrational Frequency
		Set Up
			Source
				Laser

Vibrational spectroscopy
	Foure Transform Infared (FTIR) Spectrometer
		Michelson Interferometer																Know
			All wavelengths at once, no grating
			Source (Glow bar) to beam-spliter  
				Stationary Mirror 
				Moving mirror (\delta)
					Known \delta can get math?
				Ideally a block spectrum 
			If the same constructive
			If opposite Destructive: \delta = \frac{\lambda n }{2}
			Always have to do a background sample: I_{0}
			Beer's law
			A = \epsilon (\bar{\nu}) c l 
				\epsilon 
				\bar{\nu} molar absorbtivity 
				c concentration
				l path-length
		Sample often purged with nitrogen to get rid of H2O CO2
		
		Example
			f(t) vs t is A[\sum cos]
			F(\nu) vs \nu/MHz Lines
			Forie trandform F(\nu) = \int f(t) exp(-i 2pi \nu t) dt
	(frequency domain spectrum vs time domain spectrum vs wavenumber domain spectrum)
	Vibrational within Electronic
	
	Raman Spectroscopy
		non resonance scattering technique
		
		molecule to a virtual state ?Electronic? (not electron)
			Elastic scattering (rayleigh scatering): Straight back down to ground ELectronic and vibrational
			Inelastic scattering down to ground electronic and vibrational n=1, stokes peak (redder)
			If any electronic ground vibrational n=1 excited up then to ground ground Anti-stokes (bluer)
		
		Source (Laser, single wavelength, high power)
		Strong and good Filters are important
			Monochromator 
		Collection optics
		Detector
		Resolution limits depend on each of the optical elements. 
		
		Be able to draw schematics
			scattering process
		
	Why don't we see the same thing in both spectrum? IR and Raman
		IR: Why don't we see O2 and N2?			in IR: dipole 
			asymetric and bend give dipole !!
			Homogenous Diatomic Can't be seen because no dipole
			Must be resonant with transition (i.e. will absorbe)must be right energy to absorbe 
			Oscillating dipole transitions 
			Symetry is hard to find dipoles
			Bend often has degenerate states
		Raman:
			Polarizability ie induced dipole
			u_{ind} = \alpha \epsilon
			Should always be raman active, but IR is ehh? (Some details make it hard to measure?) Why could be not see raman
			\epsilon =  \epsilon_{0} cos(2 pi \nu t)
			\mu_{ind} = \alpha \epsilon = \alpha \epsilon_{0} cos(2 pi \nu t)
			as vibrating they are inherently polarizing
			End up with three terms
			Rayleigh, stokes, antistokes
			
			Transition moment integral
			Harmonic oscillator (vibrational modes): 
				U(x) = 1/2 k xT^2
				what is probability of transition
				if try to do it with time independent always get n=0 
				need time dependent wave function 
				n=0 to n=1 
				super position of states
				
				two contributions to potential energy
				
				math in textbook
				
				c1*c1 = \epsilon_{0}^2 M_{01}^{2} t / 4 \hbar^2

				Transition morment integral 				
				M_{01} = M_{0 \to 1}  = \int \psi* ec \psi dx
				if dipole is constant wrt x it's pop out
				then it's just orthoganality
				which is just 0
				
				similar derivation for raman 
				is similar 
				IT \hat{\mu}
				Raman \hat{\alpha}
