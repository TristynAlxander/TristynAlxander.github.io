#Stereochemistry 

Stereochemistry is the chemistry related to the shape of the molecule, rather than its mere chemical formula.

The concepts of Isomers and Chirality, while intertwined, should be thought of as separate.
Isomers require the comparison of two molecules. Chirality refers to a single molecule.

	Isomers: Same Molecular Formula
		Constitutional / Structural Isomers 
			Skeletal
			Positional / Regioisomers
			Functional
		Stereoisomers / Spacial Isomers: Same Atomic Connectivity
			Non-Superimposable Rotations
			Enantiomers: Mirror Images
				All S/R-Chirality Swap^[~]("Rough Rule")
			Diastereomers: Non-Mirror Images
				Some, but not All, S/R-Chirality Swap^[~]("Rough Rule")
				Cis/Trans Isomers	Two Substituents
				Z/E Isomers			More than two different substituents
				Conformers
					Rotomers
	Chirality
		Achiral (Optically Inactive): Mirror Plane
			No Rotation of polarized light
			Superimposable Mirror Image
			Meso: Chiral Centers in achiral molecules.
		Chiral (Optically Active): No Mirror Plane
			Properties of Chiral Molecules
				Rotates polarized light.
				Non-Superimposable Mirror Image
			Clockwise (Right)
				Dextrorotatory (+) Optical Activity
				Rectus (R) Chirality
			Counterclockwise (Left)
				Levorotatory (-) Optical Activity
				Sinister (S) Chirality

				Cahn–Ingold–Prelog Priority [MD](3_Chem/Cahn-Ingold-Prelog_Priority.md)
				Last into Page/Board.
				Draw Circle First to Last
				Note: You can flip two groups location and Invert Chirality

Steric effects play a significant role in the stability and conformation of a molecule, which in turn effects how it reacts.

	Rotamers
		Rotational Conformations about a Single Bonds
		Newman Projections
			Circles In Circles: Smallest Front
			Branches
				Staggered Formation: Less Energy
					Anti:	Lowest Energy Conformation
					Gauche:	Not Lowest Energy
						Gauche^- : Substituents on right
						Gauche^+ : Substituents on left 
				Eclipsed Formation: More Energy
					Larger substituents larger energy differences
	Cycloalkanes
		Strain and Stability
			Angle Strain: Deviation from 109^o
			Torsional Strain: Eclipsed Bonds
			Steric Strain: Physical Closeness
		Axis, Equator, and Face
			Axial Bonds and Substituents: 
				Roughly Parallel with Axis.
				Alternate between Parallel and AntiParallel
				Axial has larger Steric Strain than Equatorial
			Equatorial Bonds and Substituents
				Parallel to non-adjacent bonds
			Faces 
				*cis-* Same Face
				*trans-* Different Faces
				Substituents on every carbon bond are in different faces
		Bridgehead Carbons 
			carbons linking multiple Cycloalkanes
		Conformations

	Alkenes
		Stability of Alkenes: [img0](structures/Propene.svg) < [img0](structures/2-methyl-1-Propene.svg)^? < [img0](structures/cis-2-butene.svg) < [img0](structures/trans-2-butene.svg) < [img0](structures/2-methyl-2-butene.svg) < [img0](structures/2,3-dimethyl-2-butene.svg)
		Degree of Unsaturation: [(2*Carbons+2)-Hydrogenss]/2
