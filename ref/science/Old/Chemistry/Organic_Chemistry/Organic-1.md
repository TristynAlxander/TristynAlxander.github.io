# Resonance




## Formal Charge
## Resonant Forms

Different forms only differ in pi-bonds or nonbonding pairs
Nucli in Same Place in space
	Base Sigma bonds stay in tact
	Actual Hybridization can seem ambiguous
		Are electrons delocalized
	Not necessarily the way you initially imagine it
	Electrons start delocalized (think molecular orbitals)
	Keep same 3D Geometry whole time, but ambiguous when looking at 2 Structures
