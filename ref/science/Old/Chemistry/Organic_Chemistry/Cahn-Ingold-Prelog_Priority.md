##Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priority
	Determining Rank
		Redraw Double & Triple Bonds
			As a separate, single atom, branch.
			Duplicate the multi-bonded atom.
		Rank by Atomic Weight
			Heavier to Lighter
			For Ties, Next Bonded Atoms
	Example:
		[img3](Img/Cahn-Ingold-Prelog_Priority_Example.svg)
		It wise to redraw the structure immediately; however, we can make some initial observations.
			Branch [A] has the highest atomic number with Oxygen, so [A] = 1
			Branches [B], [C], and [D] are tied.
			The next atom for [B] has a double bond.
			We must redraw the structure at this point.
		[img3](Img/Cahn-Ingold-Prelog_Priority_Example2.svg "Redrawn")
		The highest atomic number on the first atom of each branch is [A]'s Oxygen, so [A] = 1
		Branches [B], [C], and [D] are tied with Carbons.
		We move to the next highest atomic numbers.
			[B] and [D] are tied with two Carbons.
			[C] only has Hydrogens, so [C] = 4
		We move to the next highest atomic numbers
			Along either [D] branch there are three Hydrogens. 
			In [B] we have to compare the branch with the first highest atomic number. 
				*Nothing* has an atomic Number of zero.
				Hydrogen has an atomic Number of one. 
				[B]'s CH2 branch represents it.
			Hydrogens on each branch are tied, until [B] runs out.
			[D]'s Hydrogen's atomic number of one is greater than [B]'s Nothing's atomic number of zero.
				[D] = 2
				[B] = 3
		In summary:
			1 = [A]
			2 = [D]
			3 = [B]
			4 = [C]
