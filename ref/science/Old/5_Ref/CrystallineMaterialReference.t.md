Silicon



Ionic Materials
	NaCl Structure: Two inter-penetrating FCC Lattice, would be simple cubic if all same atom. 
		FCC Lattice with two atom basis. 
		large size disparity.
	CsCl Structure: Two inter-penetrating simple cubic lattices, would be BCC is all atoms the same.
		SC with two atom basis.
		Similar in size
	Ions is attributed to size
	note: Na is smaller than Cl after the electron transfer
Covalent Materials
	Diamond structure: FCC lattice + 2 attom basis (same atom)
	Zinc bond structure: FCC lattice + 2 atom basis (different atoms)
	Wurzite structure: hexgonagal lattice + (4atom basis)
		same as the other two but rotate the layers
		Example: ZnO
