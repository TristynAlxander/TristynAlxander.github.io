Drude Model (1900)

Electrical Conductivity:
	Ohm's Law: v=IR
	Wire: Length (L) Cross Section Area (A)
	R = \rho L / A
		R		Resistance
		\rho	Resistivity
	\sigm = 1/\rho		Conductivity 
	Alt forms of Ohm's law
		E = \rho J
		J = \sigma E
		J=I/A
		E = V/L
		dx = v_[d} dt 
		I=\frac{n v_{d} dt A (-e)}{dt}
		J = \frac{n v_{d} dt A (-e)}{A dt} =  n v_{d} (-e)
		
			n free electrons per unit volume 
		v = e E / m   *t + v_{th}
		v = - e E /m  * tau
		J =  n e^2 E /m  * tau 
		\sigma =  n e^2 /m^{*}  * tau
		\tau = \ell / v_{r}
		v_{r} = v_{0} = random velocity  = thermal velocity (set kinetic energy equal to thermal energy)
.
\rho = m /n e^2   1/tau
Sources of internal electron scattering
	phonons (obviously Temp dependent)
	Static
		Impurities
		lattice defects 
			dislocations
			missing atoms
			interstitial defect
.
1/tau = 1/tau_{ph} + 1/tau_{i}
tau_{i}		impurities (residual)
tau_{ph}	phonons (ideal)
tau = \ell / v

\ell = 1/(n tilda{sigma} )
tilda{sigma} = scattering cross section, measure of how big an area the impurity will cause an event ~~ 1 \AA^2


\rho_{i} = m v tilda{sigma} n  / e^2 \eta?

rho_{ph} = mv / \eta e^2  \ell_{ph}
rho_{ph} = mv pi <x>^2 /  e^2  
rho_{ph} = mv pi/  e^2  2kb/alpha  theta_{e} / e^{theta_E / T}-1
rho_{ph} = mv pi/  e^2  2k_b/\alpha  T
	linear
tilda{sigma}_{ph} = pi \left< x \right>^2
\left< x \right> = \left< E \right> = k_{B} \theta_{E}/ e^{\theta_{E}??????????????}

C = 4.5 R at high temp (wrong!!!)
so C_{e} << 3/2 R
so we need quantum

particle in a box

E = \hbar ^2 K^2 / 2m = h^2 / (8mL^2) n^2
E = \hbar ^2 K^2 / 2m = h^2 / (8mL^2) (n_{x}^2+n_{y}^2+n_{z}^2)
puli exclusion -- no two fermions can go to the same energy state

Fermi Sphere
	\epsilon = \frac{p^{2}}{2m}
	p = \hbar k
	1D: k = \frac{n 2 \pi}{\lambda}
	Fill states until we reach charge neutrality.
	shortest wavelength
	Filled stats are in the sphere
	Empty are outside sphere
	E_{F} = \frac{\hbar^2 k_{F}^{2} }{2m^{*}} = \frac{v_{F}^{2} m^{*}}{2} 
Thermal Conductivity
	electrons play significant role in transporting heat, even thoguh they don't store much
	Q = - K dT/dx
	Metals
		Free electrons and phonon
		K = K_{e} + K_{ph}
		n_{e} =~= 10^23 /cm3
		v_{s} = \sqrt(Y/\rho)
		K = 1/3 C_{v} v \ell 
How do we measure Effective Mass and valency each atom. 
	(Measuring valency is a way of measuring the doping)
	Use Magnets! 
	Lorentz force: q \vec{v} \times \vec{B}
	cyclotron
		F=m^{*} a=qvB
		a=v^2/r
		m^{*} v^2/r (-\hat{r}) = -evB \hat{r}
		m^{*} v^2/r = evB 
		m^{*} v/r = eB 
		m^{*} \omega r/r = eB 
		\omega = eB / m^{*}
		To measure this frequency pass a magnetic field through a thin film (confining helical elemenents)
		Shoot a photon at it. watch absorbtion vs freqency hit resonance frequency. 
		absorbs becuse there is an ossilating electric field (light) at that same frequency which is pumping the system
		
		can also calculate a time to make arround the loop. --- this time must be lower than scattering/ relaxation time. if you want a sharp resonance anyway. 
		
		
		10^4 causs = 1 Tessla 
		Tessla is really big
		if you want T>1/2 you have to use a super conducting magnetics
		
		(plasmon is the phonon of valence electrons (rather than of the lattice))

	Hall Effect
		Add magnetic Field to wire.
		Accumulation of negative charge on the bottom of the wire, (posotive on top. )
		Hall votlage and Hall electric field comes from this. 
		At equilibrium
		F_{E} = F_{B}
		E=vB
		V = E d
			V Voltage
			d thickness of wire
		.
	J = -n e v_{d}
		drift velocity
	v_{d} = -J/ne
	E_{H} = -J_{x} /ne   B = R_{H} J B
	R_{H} = -1/ne
	then solve for n
	
	n = z \rho N_{A} / A
	z = -A/R_{H}\rho N_{A}e
	z = valency
	A = molecular weight 
	
	z_{Cu} = 1 ish
	\rho = m^{*}/n e^2 \tau
	E_{F} = 1/2 m v^2
	\ell = v_{F} tau 
	
	E_{F,f} -  E_{F,i} / E_{F,i}
	\alpha = 1/V (dV/dT)
	integral alpha dT = \int _{v_{0}}^{v_{F}} dV/V

	Some elements have positive hall coefficient
		negative means electron carry current. 
		positive means hols carry the current.

e = elementary charge (not electron), so for an electron q=-e
