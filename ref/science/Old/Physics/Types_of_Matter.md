#Types of Matter
	Pure Substances
		Elements
			Isotopes
		Compounds
			[Isomers]("Same Formula, different structure")
				Constitutional / Structural Isomers 
					Skeletal
					Positional / Refioisomers
					Functional
				[Stereoisomers / Spacial Isomers]("Same connectivity")
					[Enantiomers]("Mirror images of Each Other")
					[Diastereomers]("Not Mirror Images of Each Other")
						[Epimers]("One difference in chiral centers.")
						Cis/Trans Isomers
						Z/E Isomers
						Conformers
							Rotomers
			Chirality
				[Chiral]("No Mirror Plane")
					S-Chirality
					R-Chirality
					Spherical Chirality 
				[Achiral]("Mirror Plane")
					[Meso]("Chiral Centers")
		Molecule
	Mixtures
		[Homogeneous]("1 phase")
			Phases Classes
				[Solids]("Distinct Volume, Distinct Shape")
					Crystal: Long range order
					Amorphous (Glasses): No order
				[Liquids]("Distinct Volume, Indistinct Shape")
					Solution: Sum of Constitutes.
						Constituents:
							Solvent: Dissolves 
							Solute: Dissolved
				[Gases]("Indistinct Volume, Indistinct Shape")
				Soft Matter: Low mechanical Moduli.
				Condensed Matter: Meaningful Interatomic Interactions.
				Fluid: Flows in response to shear stress.
		[Heterogeneous](">1 phase, Composites")
			Colloids: Two Phase mixtures, <10um
				Sol: solid in liquid
					Gels
						Physical Gels
						Chemical Gels
				Aerosol: liquid or solid in gas
				Emulsion: liquid in liquid
					Microemulsions: <100nm, Stable with surfactants
					Macroemulsions: >100nm, Unstable
					Amphiphiles: Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Ends
						Surfactants (surface active agents)
							Lyophobic: Repelled from solvent
							Lyophilic: Attracted to solvent
						Aggregate Morphologies
							Spherical Micelles
							Cylinders
							Bilayers
							Vesicles
				Colloidal Crystals
			Fiber-Reinforced Composite
				Random
