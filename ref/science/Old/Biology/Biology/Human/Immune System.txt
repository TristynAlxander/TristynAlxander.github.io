	No Making Proteins 
	minutes
	Signalling by Ca2+ or reactive oxygen species (ROS)
	
Innate 
	always present & Immediate Response (hours)
	
	epithelial barriers
	phagocytic leukocytes
		macrophages
			Like sentinels
			Origin: bone marrow
			Abundance in risk locations (lungs, gut)
			
			phagocytize  cell debris, foreign materials, and pathogens
			ROS
				superoxide
				Hydrogen PerOxide 
			ID Self vs not
				pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
					toll like receptors (TLRs)
						Humans have at least 10 TLRs
						Activation ->  immune signalling cascades -> proinflammatory cytokines
		neutrophils
	dendritic cells
	natural killer (NK) cells, 
	circulating  plasma  proteins
