# Citations & Documentation

## When to Cite.

**Cite anytime the idea isn't either original or commonly-known.**
Romantic, Naive, or De Novo Originality may well not exist. One might say everything is a remix. 
As such, it's important to understand the standards of originality in a given context: That is what qualifies as a substantive contribution?
Similarly, what's commonly-known changes in the context of things such as history and audience, and one must be sensitive to theses contexts as well. 

## What to Cite.

In no particular order, all of the following information should be present: Name of the Work, Location Found, Relevant Dates, and Relevant Persons.
For the sake of completeness Names of Works *ought* include subtitles and any other details that assist in identifying the work. The name is distinctly different from the Location Found. 
The Location Found ought include a gradient from broad information to specific information. 
It ought provide a very practical search parameters at every stage: Broad, is one looking in print or digital; mid-range, journal names; lower-range, volumes and page numbers; all the way down to specific URLs and other ID Codes.
Relevant Dates, such as the Dates Published and Retrieved, should also be included for sake of giving the information context. 
Lastly, and largely due to culture (whether of specialization or egotism is beyond me), Relevant Persons should be included in all citations. 
Who's relevant and why is a bit of gray area; however, it ranges from Contributing Authors, Financial Resources, Intellectual Property Holders, and Publishers.

## Gathering & Organizing 

	**Citation Mining**: Using another work's citations to identify relevant works, groups, and people.
	**Cross-Referencing**:  Document excerpts from  referenced texts. 
	**Outlining**: Outline Papers with their Citations. Usually one's own papers.
	**Cross-Checking**: Sources that use different methods to verify each other. 

###Paper Writing Protocol
	Step 1: [Research]("Research comes first, so you'll have enough to talk about.")
		Organizing Citations in your Citation Manager^[1](https://www.zotero.org/),[2](https://www.mendeley.com/)
			Make Folder for the Paper
			Make Subfolders for Subsections
			Folder Rules
				Citations can  go in multiple folders
				Bulk Citations must go in bottom level folders
		Finding that first Paper
			Sometimes a simple search will do.
		[Citation Mining]("Using another work's citations to identify relevant works, groups, and people.")
			Google Scholar has a "Related articles" button, which typically gives more from the same group.
				Try to cite the most updated version of any set of near identical articles (assuming it's well cited).
			You can filter by date.
			You can also look into the authors on a variety of sites (Google Scholar, Research Gate, etc.)
	Step n: Outlining.
		The Basic Outline is from folders in the Citation Manager
		Add Subsections for Specific Citations.
		Attach Outline to Paper in Citation Manager
		(Optional) Delete Folder in Citation Manager
