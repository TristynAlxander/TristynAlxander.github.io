approximately normally distributed
	The mean, median, and mode are all nearly equal. 
	The data are grouped fairly symmetrically about the mean. 
	About two-thirds of the data are within 1 standard deviation of the mean. 
	Almost all of the data are within 2 standard deviations of the mean. 

Scatterplots

	x-axis: (Continuous) Measurand
	Visuals: Just dots
	
Time Plots
	y-axis: (Continuous) Time
	x-axis: (Continuous) Measurand
	Visuals: Connect the dots
