# Path-sampling strategies for simulating rare events in biomolecular systems

## Introduction
	Time Scales
		long-timescale = milliseconds
		conventional simulations < 10 &micro;s
			Makes important transitions rare.
	Molecular Dynamics Size
		Time Length
		System Size
	Path Sampling
		Transitions States
			focus computing on transition states, not stable states
			transition states are shorter time spans 
			Can see things too fast for wet labs
		Can produce rigorous rate constants
		Produces *ensemble of transition trajectories*
			Each trajectory with quantified probabilities
		Have to watch for under sampling
	Paper only covers approaches "well-founded in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics"

## Path sampling methods and recent advances

	**Conceptual Framework**
		Path Sampling Exploits Timescale Differences (e.g. rare natural unfolding)
		Path Sampling useful in ambiguous timescales (e.g. collisions)
		Good for measuring non-equilibrium observables (e.g. Rate constants)
			Have to account for Molecule's history
			"Path Theory" helps avoid "Markov Assumption"?
	**Methods using complete paths**
		Transition Path Sampling (TPS)
			Based-On	Pratt’s^^[?](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.451695) suggestion to run Monte Carlo simulations on trajectories
			Advanced-By	Chandler and coworkers^^[?](https://doi.org/10.1039/A801266K),[?](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.478569),[?](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.physchem.53.082301.113146)
			trial perturbations on (aka pokes the) existing trajectories
			Metropolis Acceptance Criterion^^[?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm)
		Dynamic Importance Sampling (DIMS)
			proposed by Woolf, but based on earlier work
			independent transition trajectories via biased dynamics
			"reweighted" with ratio of sampled to true probability
	**Methods using trajectory segments: region-to-region**
		"Most current path-sampling approaches work procedurally^^? with trajectory segments"
		Bin-to-Bin
		Interfaces
		Weighted Ensemble
			Huber and Kim proposed it, similar to ‘splitting’ described by Kahn
			Separate into bins
			Run unbiased trajectories in parallel
			replicate successes  
		adaptive multilevel splitting
			trajectory splitting
			no bins
		Interracial approaches are being adapted for bin-to-bin
		Markov state models can use bin-to-bin 
		discrete path sampling approach - energy basins for bins 
	**Approaches using trajectory segments: interface–interface**
		Most use Different trajectory lengths that start and end on interfaces
		nested trajectories (connecting?) vs arbitrary 
		transition interface sampling
			uses transition path sampling to generate ensembles 
		Forward flux sampling
			Non  transition path sampling
		Non-equilibrium umbrella sampling
			Some use non-nested interfaces 
		Milestoning
			Has been generalized for arbitrary interfaces
	**Limitations**
		unbiasedly focusing on transition regions, not stable states, requires transition trajectories are correlated?
		correlations imply a reduction in information content: 1 in 100 transitions are "truly independent"
		require careful analysis for correlations and sampling quality
		where not correlated there are other inneffeciencies. 
		potential dangers 
			trajectories at fixed time intervals 
			interface-based methods require ‘catching’ trajectories in the act of crossing boundaries
		
## Successes

	**Protein conformational transitions and folding processes**
		substrate-induced conformational changes in enzymes
			milestoning has generated ms conformational transitions
		large conformational transitions in membrane transport proteins
			weighted ensemble outward-to-inward-facing transitions using coarse-grained simulations
			Dynamic importance sampling
		Applications of path sampling
			focused on mini-proteins &micro;s timescales
				single-replica multistate transition interface sampling
				Forward flux sampling
	**Protein (un)binding processes**
		intermediate states make this hard
		Weighted Ensemble allowed for atomistic simulations of both binding (protein–peptide) and unbinding (protein–ligand)
		
## Challenges
	Timescale
	"Coordinates [(bins or interfaces)] and correlations present the primary methodological challenge."
	"path sampling tools are likely to continue to require considerable user expertise in yielding reliable results."
	

## Questions
	What does "Bias" mean in the context of Molecular Dynamics Simulations?
	What is "Path Theory"? Something about molecule's history when calculating rate constants. 
	What is the Markov Assumption? "Path Theory" helps avoid "Markov Assumption"?
	What are Brownian Dynamics compared to Molecular Dynamics?
