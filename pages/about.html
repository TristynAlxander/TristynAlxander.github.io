<b>About Me: </b> I consider myself a simple person who merely wants to survive comfortably. 
The issue is that I don't want to die. Sure, most people don't, but I'm not resigned to the inevitability of death.
As such, I'm determined to solve aging and every other non-congenital, non-contagious disease. 
In my opinion, these are not poorly understood conditions; and thus, the solution is not deeper studies. 
Rather, the solution is in determining how to apply pre-existing knowledge. 
As such, my long-term goal is to create a cell-mediated gene-delivery system.
