<b>About Me: </b> I consider myself a simple person who merely wants to survive comfortably. 
The issue is that I don't want to die. Sure, most people don't, but I'm not resigned to the inevitability of death.
As such, I'm determined to solve aging and every other non-congenital, non-contagious disease. 
In my opinion, these are not poorly understood conditions; and thus, the solution is not deeper studies. 
Rather, the solution is in determining how to apply pre-existing knowledge. 
As such, my immidiate goal is to create cell-mediated gene-delivery system.
</p><p>
To that end, I have a number of interests (and skills). 
The interests directly relevant to my goal include: Immunology &amp; Virology, Cell-Therapies,  Gene-Editing, Membrane-Trafficking, and Protein-Engineering. 
The interests that support my goal include: programming, lab-robotics, Money, Finaince, Investing, and Algorithmic-Trading.
