<h1>On Truth</h1>
<br/>

<p>
The conceptual framework for truth is categorical with each category arising from combinations of different <i>standards of truth</i>.

These standards are the bases on which truth value 
 
While  many standards of truth, just four are sufficient for both practical and epistemic purposes. 
These four standards can be divided into two self-evident standards and two social standards. 


The self-evident standards logically precede the

Some standards of truth are derived from self-evident and fundamental concepts: nothingness,<sup>1</sup> existence,<sup>2</sup> distinction, and experience.
Nothingness and existence are not directly relevant, but epistemicly precede distinction. 
Distinction refers to the ability define things, and experience refers to the immutable nature of physical reality.
These are derived into two standards of truth: coherence and correspondence.
Coherence asserts truth's definitions are self-consistent, not contradictory. 
Correspondence asserts truth is consistent with physical reality.

<p>
Other standards of truth are derived from social concepts. 

The epistemics of social ______ are complicated; however, the standards of truth are easy to identify: Authority and Consensus. 
Authority asserts some individual determines truth. Consensus asserts the collective determines truth. 



A consensus of authorities asserts some particular collection of individuals determines truth.

Types of Conceptual frameworks
    Categorical Organization of Facts
    Decision trees / Logic Pathways
    Models (Math)
        Scope is the categorical information that defines where the model works
    
What is find a path to a goal? Like question driven research?
That's less an understanding and more identification of a gap in understanding

1: *Nothingness* is annoyingly ineffable. No description is technically correct; however, Martin Heidegger famously stated "The nothing itself nothings."

2: *Existence* is everything, except nothingness.
